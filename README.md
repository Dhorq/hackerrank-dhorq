# 🥋 HackerRank Solutions

A collection of my **HackerRank challenge solutions**.  
All files here contain **my answer** for the challenge, meaning each solution has **successfully passed all Codewars tests** ✅

---

## 💡 Important Notes
- The main focus right now is to **finish all challenges first**.  
- Code **refactoring and optimization** (for cleaner or more efficient code) will be done **later when I have free time**.  
- Some solutions may look quick or brute-force, since the current goal is to **get them working first**.

---

## 🧠 Goals
- Improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.  
- Strengthen practical (Currently) JavaScript coding skills.  
- Keep track of learning progress and make it easier to review later.

## 🪶 Final Note
> FOR ME. “Done is better than perfect. Refactor comes later.”
